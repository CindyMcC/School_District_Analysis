UNC - Module 4

# Project Overview
We were asked to revise the previous summary of the school district test data due to potential irregularities in the test scores for the ninth-grade at Thomas High School.  The test scores, for both math and reading, of 461 students were removed from the calculations.  The summary was then recalculated with the adjusted numbers.  Below are the revised findings.


### •	District Summary
All calculations based on the math and reading scores decreased slightly on the revised summary.

### •	School Summary
The only change in the school summary was to the Thomas High School listing.  The ninth-grade students were removed from the count used to calculate the scores to prevent a skewed view of the averages since their test scores were removed from the records.  This resulted in a slight decrease in the results.

### •	School Rankings
Thomas High School remained in second place for Percentage of Overall Passing after the ninth-grade scores were removed.  The drop from 90.94 to 90.63 still kept them ahead of Griffin High School at 90.59.

### •	Math and Reading scores by grade
There was no effect to the average scores by grade except the ninth-grade average was removed.  The other grade averages were unchanged.

### •	Scores by school spending
There was no change to the average and percentage scores per student spending.  The numbers remained consistent in each spending category.

### •	Scores by school size
Thomas High School is considered a medium size school, with a population of 1,635 students.  The removal of the test scores did not affect the overall numbers for that group.

### •	Scores by school type
The schools were divided into Charter or District schools.  Thomas High School is among the Charter schools, which includes seven other schools.  There was no impact to the scores and percentages from the removal of the test scores.

## Summary
The removal of the math and reading scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School had minimal effect on the overall averages and percentages.  The average scores for the ninth graders in the district should be considered incomplete until the Thomas High School data is resubmitted. 
Changes noted included:

•	There was a minor decrease in math scores and averages for in the overall statistics.

•	The reading scores and averages also declined slightly for the overall numbers.

•	The main impact was to Thomas High School data.  Their overall passing percentage decreased from 90.95% to 90.63%.

•	The overall passing percentage for the district fell below 65%, which could have a negative consequence on the district’s state funding.
